Relational databases
 vs.
-------------------------
NoSQL databases:
- Key-Value Stores
Data is stored in key/pairs as a hashtable where every key is unique.
- Document Databases
Stores and retrieves data as a key value pair. The value is stored as a document in JSON or XML formats.
- Columnar Databases
Work with columns and are based on BigTable paper. Each column is identified separately. Single column values are stored contiguously.
Delivers high performance and widely used to managed data warehouses.
- Graph Databases
A graph type database stores entities and the relations amongst the entities. The entity is stored in a nodes. The relationship is stored as an edge that gives a relationship between the nodes.
Compared to relational databases. a Graph database is multi-relational. Traversing relationship is fast and captured into the DB.

Other considerations:
- In-memory databases vs. persistent
In-memory databases stores only data in the main memory of the system.
Persistent databases store data in persistent media fx the hard drive.
In-memory databases are known to be faster than persistent memory.
